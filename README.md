# New Year Countdown Timer (Python)

This is a simple Python script that displays a live countdown to the upcoming New Year, followed by a “Happy New Year” message printed line by line once the countdown reaches zero.

## Features

- Automatically calculates the time remaining until the next New Year.  
- Displays a live countdown with days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Prints “Happy”, “New”, and “Year” on separate lines when the countdown ends.  
- Works on most operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) that support Python 3.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6 or higher**

No external libraries are required.

## Usage

1. Save the Python script as `new_year_countdown.py`.  
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the file.  
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python new_year_countdown.py
   ```
4. The countdown will automatically begin and continue until the New Year.


## Compatibility

This script uses only standard Python libraries (`datetime` and `time`), so it runs on all major platforms without modification.
